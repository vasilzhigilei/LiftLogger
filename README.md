# LiftLogger
A website to track users' weightlifting progress

Goal: Work on a full-stack project, friendly for usage on all devices, attain more experience with databases and data handling, as well as to learn Golang through my first project using it for the backend.

#### June 9th, 2020 ---> Version 1
* Golang backend using Gorilla/mux for HTTP requests
* PostgreSQL used for user data storage
* Redis used for session/user cache layer
* Bootstrap used for the UI, front-end written in vanilla JS (& a little jQuery), Chart.js for the chart

I had no experience in any of the aforementioned technologies (Go, Postgres, Redis, Bootstrap) prior to this project, so this has definitely been the most experience-attaining and beneficial personal project I had worked on when compared to any before. I learned a lot :)
