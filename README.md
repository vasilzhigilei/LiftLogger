# LiftLogger
A website to track users' weightlifting progress

The plan writeup:

Backend: Golang with gorilla/mux for http connections
Frontend: Bootstrap, jquery (no need for Vue, html templating done on backend)

Database: Postgresql (planned)

Additional planned feature: Use WASM in project, especially for 3D person model (likely to be made in 3D engine such as Unity or UE4)
This 3D model would likely be the defining feature of this project, since generic lift logging websites already exist.
