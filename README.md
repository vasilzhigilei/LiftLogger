# LiftLogger
A website to track users' weightlifting progress


The plan writeup:

Backend: Golang with gorilla/mux for http connections
Frontend: Hopefully Vue... If I can *eventually* get it installed. Big grrrrr.

Database: Would really like to try out postgresql (rather than my go-to, MySQL), once again, why is installing something this difficult... Another: Big grrrrr.


Backup: Use Go with gorilla/mux, but for frontend just use regular html/css/js. Generally bad solution, only worst case
